If i use global variables with fixed sized arrays, i many times don't look at 
new constraints as i move to another problem.
In a for loop the condition of stopping is not static rather the condition is evaluated 
every time.
    example: 
    for (i = 0; i < accumulate(a, a + n, 0LL); i++) {
        ...
    }
    here the time complexity will not be O(sum(a)) rather it will be O(sum(a) * n)
    because after every time the sum of n numbers is calculated
